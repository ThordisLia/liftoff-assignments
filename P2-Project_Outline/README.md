# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We are developing Hidden Gems Travel App to help you find off-the-beaten-path tourist destinations that fit your needs and location.
We here at QuaranTeam find that when traveling we desire to see the lesser known parts of the world.  If we're in New York we want
to see the now-renovated fancy bar that once housed a legendary night club - not the Statue of Liberty!  We want to find that great hiking trail near
our motel in Peoria, not the fastest route to Navy Pier.  Hidden Gems brings those experiences to your fingertips.
### Features
Hidden Gems searches near your location for user-submitted sights and experiences that fit your needs.  With filtering based 
on activity type, age/family friendliness, accessibility and cost filters you can be sure you will find the best and most relevant
travel activities every time you log in to our app.  You can also befriend other users on the platform to stay on top of their latest 
and greatest adventures.
### Technologies
Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf templates, MySQL, Hibernate, Bing maps
### What I'll Have to Learn
Incorporating Bing maps is the biggest challenge so far.
